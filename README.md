# Agent-based model (ABM) in Python to simulate Bitcoin trading dynamics against GBP

This work aimed to represent the market conditions in the BTC/GBP market. The model
was constructed using parameters from the literature, empirical data, and assumptions
based on common sense to simplify the simulation. Regarding the modelâ€™s behaviour,
many assumptions were made; however, these assumptions present limitations when
trying to represent real-world market conditions. The main limitations that could be
improved in the future are: incorporating an order book based on the price that agents
wish to buy rather than using quantities, allowing agents to make multiple orders on the
same day, enabling agents to decide how much of their wealth they want to trade
(instead of trading all of it), increasing the number of agents during the simulation and
introducing exogenous factors like a pandemic.
